				The midsummer day that both of us shared is still in that place<br>
				The tears I cry, the words I hide, they won’t spill outside<br>
				The one thing I know is that the shining blue sky goes and goes<br>

				And in the end too, I never learned a single thing of you<br>

				I know that you’re lying, that’s nothing new to me<br>

				I’ll keep singing since it’s time for goodbye<br>
				As time creeps into night until moonlight"</p>

			<h1>About Yorushika</h1>
			<p>Yorushika is a Japanese rock duo founded in 2017 represented by Universal Music Japan. The group is composed of N-buna, a former vocaloid music producer, and Suis, a female vocalist. The duo is extremely secretive, never publicly revealing their faces or holding many concerts.</p>
			<p>Yorushika is a project bringing together Vocaloid producer and illustrator n-buna with a vocalist named suis. They’ve been working together since 2017, and have actually attracted a lot of attention for a pretty young group up to this point. Multiple songs from Yorushika have racked up millions of views. Up until this point, their songs have been in the same jaunty rock zone as groups like Polkadot Stingray or Gesu No Kiwami Otome, with electric guitar being the foundation.</p>
			<p>“That’s Why I Gave Up On Music” serves as the title song to their first full-length release, serving as the closer and highlight of the whole release. The album itself is solid but leans towards a familiar Japanese rock format where gentle piano melodies wrap around driving guitar and drums. It’s fine, but pluck a random CD off the Tower Records “rock” shelf and you can probably find something that sounds the same.</p>

			<p>But “That’s Why I Gave Up On Music” stands out from the rest. That’s partially because of how the classical and rock touches come together to help give suis’ vocals a little extra lift.</p><br>

			<p style="text-align: center">My love for n-buna transcends dimensions.</p>
